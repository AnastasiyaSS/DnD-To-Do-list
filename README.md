# Drag and Drop To Do list

The main idea of the project was:
* Learn how to work with local storage;
* Practice how to create drag and drop app;
The idea to integrate it into task list seemed pretty interesting and challenging.

## Tech Stack
* JavaScript
* HTML
* Vanilla CSS
* React
* React Beautiful DnD

## Features
* An opportunity to drag the task from one field and drop it in another with different status (Is this task in progress? Or maybe it is done?);
* Local Storage usage for each field, so in case you reload the page you won't loose any task;
* A delete option for each task in case you changed your mind and don't feel like implementing it;

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
